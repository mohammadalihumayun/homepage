            <h2>Experience</h2>
            <p> Assistant Professor in the Department of Computer Science at the Information Technology University (ITU), Lahore, Pakistan. I supervise research regarding speech, audio, language, and biomedical signal processing with deep learning. Besides, I teach statistics and signal processing courses and have designed an elective course for ‘Speech Signal Processing’. Before being appointed as Assistant Professor, I worked as a lecturer for a year in the same department.</p>

        <section id="projects" class="section">
            <h2>Projects</h2>
            <p>Leading a research project involving the curation of a Phonocardiogram (PCG) dataset comprising Malaysian and UK populations, designing a novel algorithm for unsupervised anomaly detection from PCG, interpreting anomaly detection using self-explanatory models, and developing an online mobile application for real-time PCG audio diagnosis.</p>
            <p>Other notable projects include fine-tuning Transformer models for language sentence classification tasks and developing a constrained autoencoder for unsupervised representation learning in speech.</p>
        </section>

        <section id="publications" class="section">
            <h2>Publications</h2>
            <p>Published several papers focusing on deep learning for speech and language processing. Notable contributions include exploring optimal time window durations for short-term spectral speech features regarding accent classification, developing a constrained autoencoder for unsupervised representation learning in speech, and proposing a novel strategy for fine-tuning Transformer models for linguistic dialect classification tasks.</p>
